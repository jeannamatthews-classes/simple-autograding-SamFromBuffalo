What is the difference between a text file and a markdown file?
A text file is not able to add files along with photos or move the moving focus in a text. The text file is mainly plain with just typing texts

echo "# SD-class" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/SamFromBuffalo/SD-class.git
git push -u origin main

The name of respiratory I create was SD-class
